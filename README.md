# FlowlineFinder

This project is a continuation of the 'FlowlineFinder' demonstrated at the CUASHI 2017 [HydroInformatics Conference](https://www.cuahsi.org/uploads/pages/img/2017_Hydroinformatics_Program_-_Online_Version.pdf) in Tuscaloosa, AL in collaboration with [Pat Johnson](http://pjohns.github.io/pjohns). Its intention is to help users find, view and download NHD and National Water Model Data from either a desktop or mobile application. 

Of particular interest is the abilty to find nearby NHD reaches in the feild.  

Much of the data processing and gathering is driven by the [HydroData](http://mikejohnson51.github.io/HydroData/) and NWM packages with a interface driven by R Shiny.
